# Pi-hole Provider

The [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) provider is used to manage Pi-hole resources. The provider should be configured with the Pi-hole URL and the admin password (not the hashed web password).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

### Basic

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

**Note**: Authenticating via `api_token` requires a Pi-hole Web Interface version of `>= 5.11.0` (see [release notes](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v5.11)). When an API token (or the `PIHOLE_API_TOKEN` environment variable) is supplied, the provider skips the session-based login flow. Legacy password authentication remains available for older installations.

### Dynamic Provider

In the case that Pi-hole is deployed in the same root module that the provider is to be used, a `null_resource` can be used to wait for the server to become ready.
