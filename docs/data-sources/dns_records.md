# pihole_dns_records (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pihole_dns_records" "records" {}
```

> **Tip:** When this data source runs during `terraform apply` it reads whatever Pi-hole has at that moment. If you create DNS records in the same configuration, add an explicit dependency so the read happens after the resources exist. Otherwise the first apply will record an empty result and a subsequent plan will show an output-only change.

```terraform
data "pihole_dns_records" "records" {
  depends_on = [
    pihole_dns_record.static_host,
    pihole_cname_record.alias,
  ]
}
```
